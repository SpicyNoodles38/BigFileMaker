# BigFileMaker
Have you ever needed a file that needs to be of a specific size to test transfer speeds, upload limits, or other things? 
Well here's a simple program that allows you to create a file of any size from 1MB - 999GB.

How to use:
1. Enter a value between 1 and 999
2. Select one of the radio buttons for MB or GB
3. Click 'Create File'
4. Select a save location, file type (TXT or BIN), name, and click "Save As" to save
5. Your big file is saved to that location and you can use it for whatever you want.

CAUTION: I would adivse against opening these files because they will take forever to open.
